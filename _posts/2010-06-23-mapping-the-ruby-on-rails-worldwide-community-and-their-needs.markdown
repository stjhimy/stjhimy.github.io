##And...GO!

A very simple poll to define some basic informations about the worldwide Rails community.
I'm trying to provide this way a better content to the Rails community :)

It's simple, easy and quick, just a few questions to know you better and what are your Ruby needs.
Share the link if you like, the more answers I have, the better the result.

You can answer it [here](http://spreadsheets0.google.com/viewform?formkey=dDRmU01wZE01akpnaDh2LUdPVnRLT1E6MQ)

The result will be published on **Friday, 06/22/2010**
