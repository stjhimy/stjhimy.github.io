Jason Fried makes it clear, the culture of interruption:

No wonder people have to put in 60+ hours a week just to get 40 hours worth of work done.</p>&mdash; Jason Fried (@jasonfried) <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonfried/status/794212152206729216">November 3, 2016</a></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The major causes? Meetings, Slack/chat-first tools, notifications, expectations of immediate response, ASAP culture, real-time everything.</p>&mdash; Jason Fried (@jasonfried) <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonfried/status/794212890219716609">November 3, 2016</a></blockquote>
