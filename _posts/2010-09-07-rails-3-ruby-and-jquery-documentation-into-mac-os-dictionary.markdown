##This days...

I was wondering if there's a way to put the Rails documentation inside the Mac Os dictionary until i find the amazing job from [Priit Haamer](http://www.priithaamer.com/) and [Mika Tuupola](http://www.appelsiini.net). They just make it flawless and very easy.

##Files to download

- [Rails 3 documentation](http://f.priithaamer.com/dictionary/Ruby%20on%20Rails%203.0.dictionary.zip)
- [Ruby documentation](http://f.priithaamer.com/dictionary/Ruby.dictionary.zip)
- [JQuery documentation](http://www.appelsiini.net/download/jQuery.dictionary.zip)

##Installation instructions:

Unzip downloaded file into ~/Library/Dictionaries folder if you want to keep this dictionary only for yourself. You may need to create this folder if you haven't installed any dictionaries before.
To make it available for all users, drop the files into /Library/Dictionaries folder.

In some cases after unzipping the files you need to open the preferences dialog and enable the dictionary.
