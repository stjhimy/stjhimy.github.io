Someone asked if I have thought about upgrading my Macbook Air 11" and the answer is **no, I won't upgrade yet**.

Still more than enough for everything I use it for and the SSD makes it blazing fast. Basically my daily usage:

- Tmux/Vim multiple sessions
- Vagrant (2 machines at a time)
- MongoDB/Elasticsearch/PostgreSQL
- Photoshop
- Chrome

The Macbook Air 11" still the best Macbook made yet.
