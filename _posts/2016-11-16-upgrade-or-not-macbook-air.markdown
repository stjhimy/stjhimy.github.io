Someone asked if I have thought about upgrading my macbook air 11" and the answer is **na, I won't upgarde yet**.

Still more than enough for everything I use it for and the SSD makes it blazing fast. Basically my daily usage:

- Tmux/Vim multiple sessions
- Vagrant (2 machines at a time)
- MongoDB/Elasticsearch/PostgreSQL
- Photoshop
- Chrome

Macbook Air 11" still the best Macbook made yet.
