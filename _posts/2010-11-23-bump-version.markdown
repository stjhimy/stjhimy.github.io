##Changing again?

I'ts a long time since my last post, i've been working this last month in some changes in my blog, let's take a look.

##Obviously, layout

I'm releasing a new layout today, more html5 and some basic changes, new fonts colors and etc.
Hope you enjoy the new design.

##New code snippets

In the previous version of my blog i was using coderay to generate the code snippets and it's server side. In this new version i decide to use a client side javascript called [SyntaxHighlighter](http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/) and reduce my server job.

Some examples:

    #ruby
    def new_snippets
      return "awesome!"
    end

If you are reading this post in some RSS reader, click [here](http://www.stjhimy.com) to see the new layout.

And that's all, hope i can publish something new by tomorrow.Cya!.
