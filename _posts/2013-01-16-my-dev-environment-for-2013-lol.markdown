Hello Folks, I would like to share my current DEV environment for Ruby/Rails Fulltime. There is nothing too fancy, just a simple and productive environment.

## Macbook pro mid 2010

Yes, i'm still coding on a Macbook pro mid 2010, why? It's enough! It is not the fastest machine on earth but it is enough for ruby/rails/web development in general, i use it mostly for work/feeds/internet-shit. Gamming? Forget about it, i use my iPhone 4S and my xbox to do that.

## Vagrant

**/lost image/**

I've started using vagrant a few weeks ago, and i got say, it's awesome. I'm running an Ubuntu 12.04 virtual machine, 512 ram.

**Inside vagrant**

    Text Editor - Vim

    Rvm
        Ruby 1.9.3
        Ruby 1.8.7

    Dbs
        Sqlite
        Postgresql
        Mysql
        Mongodb
        Redis

I use vim inside vagrant only for quicking editing files or git commits.

**tmux**

If you don't know tmux yet, it makes managing shell sessions really easy, you can split, create new windows, create multiple sessions and stuff.

Also there's a great gem to manage complex tmux sessions (which window should open for each project), it's called tmuxinator, check this out here: [https://github.com/aziz/tmuxinator](https://github.com/aziz/tmuxinator)

## Text Editor - Macvim for the rescue

Tried lots of different editors, Sublime, TextMate, vim on bash but my heart always goes back to MacVim.

There's a pack with lots of snippets and plugins, you can find it here:

## Browser - Chrome

My default browser is Chrome (OHH BIG NEWS!) but i keep a virtual machine with Chrome/Firefox/Internet Explorer so i can test in multiples browsers...specially Internet Explorer, meh.

That's it, not a fancy environment, give us a bash, a text editor and a browser and we can do anything :-)
